# Refactored Client #435

## Usage

You'll need a 435 game cache to run the client. One is supplied in this repo, that one is loading 377 maps.

Once you have a cache, throw it into `~/.435cache/` or if you are on windows: `C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.435cache`. The update server is currently disabled, so your server won't need one. 

This client pairs well with [RuneJS](https://github.com/rune-js), a RuneScape game server written entirely in TypeScript for revision #435 of RuneScape.
