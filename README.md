# Refactored Client #435

## Usage

You'll need a 435 game cache to run the client. You can find one here: [https://github.com/rune-js/server/tree/master/cache/435](https://github.com/rune-js/server/tree/master/cache/435)

Once you have a cache, throw it into `C:/.435cache/`. The update server is currently disabled, so your server won't need one. 

This client pairs well with [RuneJS](https://github.com/rune-js), a RuneScape game server written entirely in TypeScript for revision #435 of RuneScape.
